<h2>A Cooperative Board Game</h2>
<br/>
<p class="post-blog">After months of exciting work, I am incredibly proud to introduce my current project, Light Hunters â€“ an upcoming fantasy board game on its way to be crowdfunded.<br/><br/>

Working on this project with my former classmate and now colleague <a href="http://www.dtda.fr">Serge Rodrigues</a>, was an amazing experience. We spent so many hours to polish this game (still polishing it right now) and create a fun fighting game, cooperative and accessible.<br/><br/>

I illustrated and designed each part of the game to bring the player in our mystical universe, but I'll keep the details for a longer post about the whole process. We'll soon release more infos, but for now, I am sharing a few snaps of the illustrations and the video below showing a speed drawing with black ink.</p>
