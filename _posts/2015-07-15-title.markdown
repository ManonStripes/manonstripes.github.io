Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Good morning. C'mon. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. Chuck, Chuck, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Berry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.

You'll find out in thirty years. Where does he come from? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. This sounds pretty heavy. You know what I do in those situations?

I followed you. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. You don't understand. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Who's are these?
