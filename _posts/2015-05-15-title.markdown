Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? Good morning. Who do you think, the Libyans. Stop it. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? What did you say? Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please.

That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? I, I don't know. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. Jennifer.
